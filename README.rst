Changelog
=========

0.3.0 (2020-06-10)
------------------

New
~~~

- Allows to define the behavior when encountering undefined values in the
  template.
- Allows conditional creation of files, so depending of a value a file can be
  created or not.
- Rendering is now faster when rendering empty files.
- Ninjecto's CLI now supports passing ``--parents`` to create any parent
  directory of the output directory.
- New filters: ``comment``, ``quote`` and ``read``.
- New filters from awesome Inflection_ package.

  Inflection is now a third party dependency, which includes the new filters:
  ``camelize``, ``dasherize``, ``humanize``, ``ordinal``, ``ordinalize``,
  ``parameterize``, ``pluralize``, ``singularize``, ``tableize``, ``titleize``,
  ``transliterate`` and ``underscore``.

  Also, the Cerberus dependency was dropped as it is unused (for now).
